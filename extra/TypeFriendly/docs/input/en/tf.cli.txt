Title: Command line interface

---

TypeFriendly is used only from the operating system command line. It supports both Windows systems and various Unix clones, including Linux. You can call the script in this way:

~~~
[console]
# Under Windows and Unix systems
php typefriendly.php

# Under Unix systems (since TF 0.1.2)
./typefriendly
~~~

TypeFriendly 0.1.0 and 0.1.1
============================

The required parameter is always a path to the documentation directory (it means, to the directory that contains the `settings.ini` and other files). For example:

~~~
[console]
./typefriendly "./docs/"
~~~

Allowed options that must be provided in the alphabetical order are:

`-c LANGUAGE`
:   a tool for multilingual documentations. It compares the last modification time of the files and shows those ones in the derived language that are not up-to-date. Moreover it looks also for the missing files.

`-l LANGUAGE`
:   generates the documentation in the specified language (by default, the base language is chosen).

`-o OUTPUT`
:   generates the documentation, using the specified output only. It must be listed in the available outputs in the configuration.

Example:

~~~
[console]
php typefriendly.php "./docs/" -l en -o xhtml
~~~

To display the information about TypeFriendly, call the script without any parameters.

TypeFriendly 0.1.2 and newer
============================

In TypeFriendly 0.1.2, the command-line interface has been improved and the usage of the script has changed. The first argument is always a command specifying what we want to do. In the second place, we should specify a path to the directory with the documentation we want to process and at last, we specify the options.

The available commands:

1. **create** - creates a new documentation from a template and saves it to the specified (empty) directory. TypeFriendly asks you four questions about the newly created document and uses the values to prepare the configuration file. The use:

        [console]
        ./typefriendly create "/path/to/directory"

2. **build** - builds an output version of the specified documentation. The available (optional) options are `-l` (the language) and `-o` (the used output system). The use:
 
        [console]
        ./typefriendly build "/path/to/directory" -l en -o xhtml

3. **compare** - compares the translation to the original version. This command requires the `-l` option to select the translation.
     
        [console]
        ./typefriendly compare "/path/to/directory" -l pl

4. **version** - prints TypeFriendly version.
     
        [console]
        ./typefriendly version
