Title: Headers

---

Markdown supports two header systems: **Setext** and **atx**. Like paragraphs, they are block elements, which means that they must be separated with at least one empty line from other elements of the same type.

Setext notation
---------------

Here, the headers are "optically" underlined with equality characters `=` (first level) or pauses `-` (second level).

~~~
Header 1
========

Header 2
--------
~~~

The number of underline characters has no matter.

atx notation
-----------

This method supports all the header levels, using one to six hash symbols `#` before the header text.

~~~
# Header 1

## Header 2

##### Header 5
~~~

The text may be optionally ended with the same characters to make the header look better. The number of the characters does not have to match the header level.

~~~
# Header 1 #

## Header 2 ####

##### Header 5 #
~~~

> TypeFriendly makes a small change to the original parser. The header level in the XHTML output is always decreased by 1, because the first level (`<h1>`) is reserved for the chapter title. So, the header written as the first level will be the second level and so on. As a result, TypeFriendly supports up to 5 levels, not 6.

Sample headers:

> # Header 1
> 
> ## Header 2
> 
> ### Header 3
>
> #### Header 4
> 
> ##### Header 5 

Anchors in headers {#headers_anchors}
==================

Headers allow to create anchors, which can be used to [make a link][docs.syntax.links#links_anchors] from other parts of documentation to a particular fragment of a chapter.

The tag looks like this: `{#anchor}`. It is places after header's text in setext notation or on the end of a line in atx notation.

~~~
Header {#anchor}
========

### Header ### {#anchor}

##### Header {#anchor}
~~~

> To make header anchors unique in whole documentation, TypeFriendly adds a prefix: `h:chapter_id:` to each of them. So making a direct link to an anchor in this way: `[link](#anchor)` will not work.
