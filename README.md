# Titan Framework's Core

About
-----

Titan is a framework for instantiation of content management systems (CMS), allowing the creation of complex web applications. The **Titan Framework** proposal is to be a simple and complete development tool, allowing you to create robust applications quickly and easily.

Titan was developed and is maintained by the partnership between the [Software Engineering Laboratory (LEDES)](http://www.ledes.net) of the [Faculty of Computing (FACOM)](http://www.facom.ufms.br) of the [Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul (UFMS)](http://www.ufms.br) and the [Laboratory for Precision Livestock, Environment and Software Engineering (PLEASE Lab)](http://please.cnpgc.embrapa.br) of the [Embrapa Beef Cattle](http://www.embrapa.br/gado-de-corte) of the [Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa)](http://www.embrapa.br).

Getting Start
-------------

To start using Titan Framework, is strongly recommended create a new instance using [titan-framework/instance](https://github.com/titan-framework/instance).

To deploy a Titan Framework's instance on web server (e.g., to publish in production), you can clone (checkout) last tag of this repository or use [titan-framework/install](https://github.com/titan-framework/install) Composer package.
